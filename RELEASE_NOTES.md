# V1700 Stage143 - User CLI/API Minimum Docs

Stage143 is the minimum user-documentation layer after Stage142. It converts the benchmark-ready repository into a CLI/API documentation contract while keeping migration execution, LOSDB writes, runtime training, active learning, model weight updates, provider calls, canon mutation, and AutoRepair mutation blocked.

## Release Highlights

- Stage134 remains audit-only, Stage135 remains candidate-only, Stage136 remains schema-only, Stage137 remains migration-plan-only, Stage138 remains storage-contract-catalog-only, Stage139 remains corpus-governance-pipeline-only, Stage140 remains release-integrity-gate-only, Stage141 remains local-E2E-only, Stage142 remains benchmark-pack-only, and Stage143 remains docs-only.
- README, pyproject, package manifest, live manifest, and release notes are checked for deterministic Stage143 alignment.
- Release asset declarations are verified against the canonical Stage143 package contract.
- The repository now emits CLI help, CLI sample outputs, a documentation-only API contract, and a user-doc index.
- Stage144 split-CI/runtime readiness is produced without enabling writes.
- Migration execution remains disabled.
- LOSDB writes remain disabled.
- Runtime training remains disabled.
- Active meta-learning remains disabled.
- Model weight updates remain blocked.
- Provider calls remain zero in release gates.
- Node2 raw reveal access remains zero.
- Canon auto-resolution and AutoRepair mutation remain blocked.
